# PseudoEditor

This was meant to be the editor for [PseudocodeInterpreter](https://github.com/brown121407/PseudocodeInterpreter).
For now this repo is frozen. May continue work once .NET Core 3.0 gets released.
It is also possible the this will be abandoned if I decide to try and implement a language server for vscode or other editor.
